  In this project, we have developed a game on website that targets Mario’s game fans. The idea of the game is to help Mario avoid touching the enemies. We have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Php to implement the Mario Chrome game. 

## Goals

## 1.Flow Chart
 Figure 1: Flowchart
 
## 2.Look & Feel  
In this game, we are simulating the design of a Mario game using JavaScript. We have chosen Mario because it was the best childhood game for most kids of our generation. Also, we have used CSS to design the registration page and login page. Eventually, we picked the character, enemies and background from the internet and then connected them to our game [1].
## 3.Dynamic Components 
In “index.php” we have used three scripts that connect three JavaScript files with this web page.
## 4.Business Logic 
The database has been created on phpMyAdmin with name “project” and contain one table include named “users”. Users include of six columns, which are id, user_id, user_name, password, score and date each column should be completed all fields once play for once.

“INSERT” query has been used for the registration to insert the information of the user for the first time. “SELECT” used for the login to ensure that the entered data is already exists. Also, “UPDATE” query is used to update the user score, if the current score greater than the exists score. 

Regarding to the HTML we have used a form to make the user fill his information and once the user click the submit button, we will directly deal with the server side to register a record or to check if the record is already inside the database using php.
